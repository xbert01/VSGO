# VS:GO

Vs:Go is my most advanced group project. 
To create it we have used React technology with open-source REST API. 
Using the latest data you can easily find out how much you know about cryptocurrency and compare your score with friends. 
The project is still being developed, so soon you will be able to test your knowledge in many other areas such as for example, football.
